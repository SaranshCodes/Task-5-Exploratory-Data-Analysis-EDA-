# Titanic Data Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to understand passenger demographics and survival patterns.

## Key Insights

* **Fare**: Most passengers paid low fares; a few paid extremely high fares.
* **Age**: Distribution is roughly normal, with most passengers between 20â€“40 years old.
* **Pclass & Survival**: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate than second and third class.
* **Correlation**: Negative correlation between `Pclass` and `Survived` (higher class = higher chance of survival).
* **Age & Survival**: Survivors tended to be slightly younger on average.

## Visualizations

* Histograms for `Fare` and `Age`.
* Pairplot comparing `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass` with survival status.
* Heatmap showing correlations between numeric features.
* Boxplot comparing age distribution for survivors vs. non-survivors.
